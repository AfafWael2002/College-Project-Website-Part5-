Database Management System - Backend (MySQL & PHP)

Project Overview
----------------
This project is part of a larger system designed to manage and interact with a relational database. The backend, developed using PHP and MySQL, is responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and processing through a set of structured and secure APIs and server-side scripts.

Responsibilities
----------------
As the backend developer, my main responsibilities included:

- Designing and normalizing the database schema for efficient data storage.
- Implementing server-side logic in PHP to handle CRUD operations.
- Creating secure and optimized SQL queries for data access and manipulation.
- Integrating the backend with the frontend (if applicable) via API or server-rendered pages.
- Ensuring data validation, sanitation, and security against threats such as SQL injection.
- Testing and debugging the PHP backend and MySQL queries to ensure robust performance.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- PHP: Server-side scripting for handling application logic and business rules.
- MySQL: Relational database system for structured data storage.
- phpMyAdmin (optional): GUI for managing the database (if used).

Setup Instructions
------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git

2. Import the MySQL Database:
   - Locate the `.sql` file in the `Database` directory.
   - Use phpMyAdmin or command line:
     mysql -u root -p database_name < path/to/database.sql

3. Configure Database Connection:
   - Open the PHP config file (e.g., `config.php`) and set your database credentials:
     $host = 'localhost';
     $user = 'your_username';
     $pass = 'your_password';
     $db   = 'database_name';

4. Run the Backend Locally:
   - Start a local server  (eg. XAMPP, MAMP, or built-in PHP server).
   - Access the application via http://localhost/your-project-folder/.
